 (19 requests)
Central routing to all microservices
Smart auth handling - public endpoints bypass JWT check
Admin endpoints: Metrics, logs, rate limits
🔐 JWT Authentication Configured
All collections use Bearer Token authentication with {{jwt_token}} variable:

Login requests auto-save JWT tokens to environment
Pre-request scripts validate token presence
Public endpoints (health, login, register, tracking) skip auth

🚀 Next Steps
Start your microservices on ports 5000-5003
Test authentication: Run "Login via Gateway" or "Login" in Auth Service
Verify JWT flow: Token will auto-save and be used in subsequent requests
Run collections: Use Collection Runner to test entire workflows
Set up monitors: Automate testing on a schedule
Everything is ready to go! Would you like me to help you test the authentication flow or create any additional requests?
